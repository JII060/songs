We put on the whole armour of the King
So that we stand and fight against the enemy
Though weapons they may form
But won't succeed
We already declare the victory
Let the redeemed of the
Lord tell their stories
By his grace we are walking testimonies
For thine is the kingdom and the glory
And we'll praise You Lord
Forever cause You're holy
We put on the whole armour of the King
So that we stand and fight against the enemy
Though weapons they may form
But won't succeed
We already declare the victory
