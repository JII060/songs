Last Christmas, I gave you my thug shaker
But the very next day, you sold it on craigslist
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to You

I'm dreaming of a thug Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the thug shakers glisten and children listen
To hear Santa shaking it in the snow

You were big and tall
You were oily
Monarch of Wordington
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
The crowd were swinging
All the children they were singing
You asked me to shake it
And then we did shake it

But then last Christmas, I gave you my thug shaker
And the very next day, you sold it on craigslist
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to You instead

You're immoral
You're greasy
Happy Christmas to you
I pray God it's your last

Rockin' around the Christmas pole
At the Christmas party hop,
Rockin' around the Christmas pole,
Let the Christmas spirit ring,
Later I'll have some "cake"
And me and You will shake it

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about toppy sloppy
I just want You for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true oh
All I want for Christmas is You

Oh, You yeah, oh You yeah
You the wordington citizen is a buff, zesty soul
You the wordington citizen is a fairy tale they say

You baby, I want you and really that is all
I'll wait up for you, dear
You baby, won't you shake it with me tonight?

So here it is, thug Christmas
Everybody's here to shake it
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

Simply having a thug Christmas time
Simply having a thug Christmas time
