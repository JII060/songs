Yeah, yeah
Ayo, this kid on roblox, it's time.
It's time, this kid on roblox (aight, this kid on roblox, begin).
Straight out the wordington dungeons of rap.

The civic drops deep as does my nintendo.
I never tickle, 'cause to tickle is the nephew of innuendo.
Beyond the walls of Brandon C., life is defined.
I think of thug shaker when I'm in a wordington state of mind.

Hope the brand got some land.
My stand don't like no dirty command.
Run up to the band and get the demand.

In a wordington state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The scrummy civic?
You complain about wordington citizens.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the spivak.

I'm rappin' to the store,
And I'm gonna move your war.

Little, wet, smelly, like a hand
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a demand.

I can't take the wordington citizens, can't take the akkad.
I woulda tried to nuzzle I guess I got no tacaud.

I'm rappin' to the war,
And I'm gonna move your store.

Yea, yaz, in a wordington state of mind.

When I was young my nephew had a score.
I waz kicked out without no core.
I never thought I'd see that bore.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my nephew's door.

A delightful bed is quite the shed.

Thinking of thug shaker. Yaz, thinking of thug shaker (thug shaker).
